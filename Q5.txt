1. No
2. Yes
3. The difference between increment_int_a and increment_int_b is that in increment_int_a,
the value of the variable is increased by one within the function, without being returned
to main. Thus, the value of the variable in main remains unchanged, at 32, but with the function
increment_int_b, the value at the address of the variable is changed and thus, the value of the 0
index is updated to 33 and can be viewed in the main function as well
