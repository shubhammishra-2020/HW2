# The difference between increment_int_a and increment_int_b is that in increment_int_a,
# the value of the variable is increased by one within the function, without being returned
# to main. Thus, the value of the variable in main remains unchanged, at 32, but with the function
# increment_int_b, the value at the address of the variable is changed and thus, the value of the 0
# index is updated to 33 and can be viewed in the main function as well
